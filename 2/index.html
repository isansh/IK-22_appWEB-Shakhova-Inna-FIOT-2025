        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. I began performing in theater and music festivals as a child, and soon discovered a deep passion for songwriting. At age 14, I signed my first record deal and moved to Nashville, Tennessee.
        </p>
        <p>
          My music blends genres like country, pop, indie, and alternative. I'm known for my deeply personal lyrics, and each of my albums represents a different chapter in my life. From *Fearless* to *Midnights*, I've embraced reinvention while staying true to my core values: creativity, honesty, and connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond music, I'm an advocate for artists‚Äô rights, equality, and education. I also enjoy baking, reading, and spending time with my cats ‚Äî Olivia and Meredith.
